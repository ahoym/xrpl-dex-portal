## pnpm lockfile rebase conflicts

When rebasing causes conflicts in `pnpm-lock.yaml`, don't attempt manual merge. Instead:

```bash
git checkout --theirs pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git rebase --continue
```

This accepts the upstream lockfile, then regenerates it with your branch's added/modified dependencies. Works because the lockfile is deterministically generated from `package.json`.
